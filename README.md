## BTS Border crossing Data EDA

### Problem Statement : 
CBP (Customs and Border Protection) does not collect comparable data on outbound crossings. Users seeking data on outbound counts want to review data from individual bridge operators, border state governments, or the Mexican and Canadian governments about the Inbound Data Analysis to uncover underlying patterns and structures from the data.

### Objective : 
Summary level insights from the dataset.
Uncover underlying patterns and structures from the data.
Relate the available data to the problem statement.

### Insights : 
1. Decrease in the frequency of inbound passenger from year 2012 to 2019 from both the borders.
2. The light vehicle category including (Personal vehicle) has most number of inbound passengers across the borders.
3. There are more number of states and port in US-Canada border when compared with US-Mexico Border however the number of inbound passengers is much more in US-Mexico Border.
4. This might be due to the fact that Canada is having less population when compared with Mexico.
5. We can observe highest inbound traffic in the following two states TX (Texas) and CA (California), might be for the reason that both are the most highly populated state in USA.
6. From the month-wise breakup of the traffic for both the borders in case of US-Canada Border, there has been a steep rise from the month of May till July. The reason might be that Canada lies in Northern hemisphere so it experiences summer season in those months. Hence we might relate more number of inbound passengers with the season since it is the most favorable time to commute by road.
7. Whereas Mexico lies near the equator, experiences hot and humid weather. 
8. In case of US-Mexico border despite the imposition of restrictions on Trade rule by the new US administration after 2016 we cannot observe any fall in trade count.
